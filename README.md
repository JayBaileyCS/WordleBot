For this project, I wanted to do some preliminary testing of my fit/suitability for machine learning without spending a bunch of time trying to learn ML. From posts I have read, a major frustration in ML is iteration time - it can take hours to run an experiment. Thus, I decided to create a simple but non-trivial program (estimated effort 2-8 hours if programming normally) and create the following rule: Each day, I am only allowed to run the program once. That means that I can't use a quick guess-and-check method and throw stuff at the wall like one can easily do in most programs where iteration times are measured in seconds or minutes. This would force me to examine my code more carefully and try to debug with my eyes and brain, not by seeing where the computer throws an error.
